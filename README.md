## 🛒 Online Shopping Cart – Python OOP Project

### 📌 Project Description

This project is a **console-based online shopping cart system** implemented using **Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**. It simulates a basic e-commerce experience where users can:

* Browse a catalog of physical and digital products
* Add items to a shopping cart
* Update item quantities
* Remove items
* View cart totals

All functionality is handled directly in the terminal, making it a great beginner-to-intermediate project for learning **OOP concepts like class, inheritance, encapsulation, access specifiers, abstract classes, class/static methods, and object interactions**.

| Abstract Classes       | `Product` class with `display()` method         |
| Encapsulation          | Protected variables (`_name`, `_price`, etc.)   |
| Access Specifiers      | Controlled access via getters/setters           |
| Composition            | CartItem contains a Product object              |
| Static & Class Methods | (Extendable for future utilities)               |
